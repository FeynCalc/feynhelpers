## KiraImplicitIncomingMomenta

`KiraImplicitIncomingMomenta` is an option for `KiraCreateConfigFiles` and other functions of the Kira interface.

It specifies incoming momenta in the original amplitude that have been eliminated using momentum conservation. These momenta may not  appear in the integrals that need to be reduced, but should be nevertheless passed to Kira. Otherwise the
reduction may not run.
