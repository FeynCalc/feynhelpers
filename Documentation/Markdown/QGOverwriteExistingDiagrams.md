## QGOverwriteExistingDiagrams

`QGOverwriteExistingDiagrams` is an option for `QGCreateAmp`, which determines the behavior of the function when the file for the generated diagrams already exists. The default value is `True`, which means that the file will be silently overwritten. Setting it to `False` will prevent the overwriting by aborting the evaluation.
