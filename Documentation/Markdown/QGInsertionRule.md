## QGInsertionRule

`QGInsertionRule["names"]` is a set of replacement rules for inserting explicit vertices, propagators and polarization vectors into the amplitudes generated by QGRAF. These rules are loaded via QGLoadInsertions. Running `QGInsertionRule[]` returns a list of the already loaded sets of rules.
