## KiraFermatPath

`KiraFermatPath` is an option for `KiraRunReduction` and other Kira-related functions.

It specifies the full path to the Fermat binary used by Kira to run the reduction. This is done via the option `KiraFermatPath`. The default value is `Automatic` meaning that suitable binaries are expected to be located in `FileNameJoin[{$FeynHelpersDirectory, "ExternalTools", "Fermat"}]`
