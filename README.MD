FeynHelpers is a collection of interfaces that allow you to use other HEP-related tools from your [FeynCalc](http://www.feyncalc.org/) session.

# Requirements

FeynHelpers is designed as an add-on for FeynCalc. To use it you need at least FeynCalc 9.2 and Mathematica 8.

# Supported tools

Tools that are currently supported are

 * [FIRE 5.2](https://bitbucket.org/feynmanIntegrals/fire)
 * [Package-X 2.1](https://packagex.hepforge.org)

# Installation

## Automatic installation

* Run the following instruction in a Kernel or Notebook session of Mathematica


    ```
    Import["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FeynCalc/feynhelpers/master/install.m"]
    InstallFeynHelpers[]
    ```

  If the above code fails with `URLFetch::invhttp: SSL connect error` (e.g. on Mathematica 9 under OS X), try

    ```
    ImportString[URLFetch["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FeynCalc/feynhelpers/master/install.m"]]
    InstallFeynHelpers[]
    ```

* The automatic installer can also install Package-X and FIRE for you. It will offer you this possiblity at the end of the installation process

## Manual installation

* Create a directory _FeynHelpers_ inside

	```
	FileNameJoin[{$UserBaseDirectory, "Applications", "FeynCalc", "AddOns"}]
	```

	and put the source code there.

* Install Package-X and FIRE packages.  It should be possible to load Package-X via

	```
	<<X`
	```

	and FIRE via

	```
	<< FIRE5`
	```

## Development version

If you like the bleeding edge and you are already using the development version of FeynCalc, you can also install the development version of FeynHelpers

```
Import["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FeynCalc/feynhelpers/master/install.m"]
InstallFeynHelpers[InstallFeynHelpersDevelopmentVersion->True]
```

# Usage
