FeynHelpers ships with the library of analytic results for Passarino-Veltman
functions `OneLoop.m` that was extracted from the now discontinued Package-X
with the kind permission of its author, Hiren H. Patel.

Package-X is not being developed or maintained anymore, so use this library
on your own risk. This also means that newly discovered bugs are not going to be
fixed and there is no guarantee that it will continue to work with newer Mathematica
versions.

If you make use of `OneLoop.m` (e.g. via PaX* functions or directly) in your scientific work,
please cite
